\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

Deepening our understanding of the evolutionary origins of modern human behavior is essential for comprehending the nature of humanity and society.
In anthropology and archaeology, ``modern human behavior" refers to traits unique to or primarily associated with Homo sapiens, marked by abstract thinking, symbolic expression, complex planning, and ultrasociality.
These behaviors include language, religion, mythology, art, music, entertainment, humor, altruism, long-distance trade, and the creation of intergroup networks.
Numerous studies concur that these behavioral patterns emerged during the Middle Stone Age (MSA) in Africa\cite{Mcbrearty2000, Henshilwood2003, dErrico2020, Wilkins2021, Bergstrom2021}.
While there is broad consensus on when and where these behaviors originated, the mechanisms driving their emergence remain enigmatic, despite various proposed theories.

For several years, hypotheses \cite{Potts1996, Potts1998, Potts2013, Potts2018, Potts2020, TrauthMaslin2007, TrauthMaslin2010, TrauthMaslin2014, Ziegler2013, Kalan2020, Siepielski2017, Faith2021} attempting to explain the evolution of hominin behavior by focusing on environmental variability (EV) in Africa during the MSA have garnered significant attention.
Among these, Potts’ variability selection hypothesis (VSH) \cite{Potts1996, Potts1998} proposes that intensified environmental change favored ``versatilists" those capable of rapid adaptation to new environments over ``specialists", who adapt to specific environments, or ``generalists", who adapt across a range of environments.
Here, EV encompasses changes in landscape dynamics (such as land-lake oscillations), climate (such as arid-moist climate oscillations), variations in flora and fauna, ultimately leading to the unpredictability of resource availability.
Initially, this hypothesis was supported by a temporal correlation between intensified environmental changes, the replacement of human species, and the increased complexity of cultural artifacts, such as stone tools and ornaments \cite{Faith2021}.
In addition, the cognitive buffer hypothesis (CBH) \cite{Schuck-Paim2008, Sol2008, Sol2009} provides a neuroscientific basis for VSH, and a mathematical model \cite{Grove2011} demonstrates its theoretical feasibility.
The CBH posits that larger brain sizes in animals, including humans, evolved as a buffer against environmental variability, enhancing survival through improved problem-solving and learning abilities.
In contrast, several theories \cite{Navarrete2011, Will2021, Stibel2023} propose that EV and behavioral diversity do not necessarily drive human encephalization.
These theories emphasize the role of social contexts, as suggested by the social brain hypothesis (SBH) \cite{Whiten1988, Dunbar1998, Barrett2007, Grove2008, Knight2011, Hayes2014, Faith2021, Dunbar2024a}, and consider other factors focus such as dietary influences \cite{DeCasien2017, Grabowski2023}.
The SBH argues that human intellectual abilities evolved in response to the selection pressures of complex social environments, which required the effective management of social relationships within and between groups.
Therefore, much remains unknown about the impact of EV on the evolution of cognitive and behavioral traits in hominins.

Our study suggests that VSH, typically explained through the CBH, may also be connected to the SBH, which is generally considered separate from both VSH and CBH.
While complex social environments encompass various factors, what uniquely characterizes human societies is the extensive and sophisticated cooperation observed, including intergroup cooperation and trade, which contrasts with the intragroup cooperation common in many animal societies.
These advanced social behaviors are central to modern human behavior, and understanding their origins requires focusing on social factors that extend beyond individual-level adaptations, such as those proposed in CBH.
Specifically, we demonstrate that EV fosters intergroup cooperation, which may have contributed to the development of complex social structures.

There are several points of concern when using the term ``group."
First, groups within the complex social environment described by the SBH are nested in a series of fractal-structured networks \cite{Bird2019, Dunbar2020, Dunbar2024a}.
As a result, when smaller groups ally and cooperate to form a larger group, whether this cooperation is viewed as intragroup cooperation within the larger group or intergroup cooperation among the smaller groups depends on the level of analysis.
For simplicity, we assume a certain level of grouping and analyze their intergroup cooperation, though this could alternatively be seen as intragroup cooperation from the perspective of a higher-level group.
Furthermore, while treating groups as units of adaptation is highly debated in evolutionary biology \cite{Smith1976, Okasha2001, Eldakar2011}, our focus here is on cultural evolution rather than biological evolution.
In this cultural context, we assume that a group has a degree of autonomy, treating individual relationships and nested group structures as a black box.
Here, autonomy suggests that the basic behavioral patterns for a group regarding which groups it cooperates with or does not are influenced by intergroup interactions and evolve over time.

In the study of the evolution of cooperation, many studies have been conducted within the framework of evolutionary game theory \cite{Axelrod1981, Nowak2006, Szabo2007, Zaggl2014, Perc2017, West2021}, though most assume a stable environment.
Only a limited number of studies consider environmental factors in the evolution of cooperation, and these, typically in biological or physical contexts, focus on aspects such as extrinsic population variability \cite{Brockhurst2007, Miller2015}, variability in game structure \cite{Gokhale2016, Stojkoski2021}, variability in the strength of selection \cite{Assaf2013}, the impact of EV on learning strategies \cite{Borg2012}, and resource pressure \cite{Pereda2017}.
However, these studies do not fully address our research objective of understanding how EVs influences the evolution of cooperation.

\section{Research Objectives}\label{sec:objectives}

Our research thus investigates how the unpredictability of resource acquisition (EV) may drive the evolution of cooperation among geographically dispersed groups, with a focus on the origins of the social aspects that characterize modern human behavior.
